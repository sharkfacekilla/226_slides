<pre>Server:
Transmits 0x00 0x01 indicating that the next transmission is 1 byte long
Then transmits the player ID, either 0x01 or 0x02

                                * Client:
				  Transmits one of 0x24, 0x34, 0x44, 0x64, 0xf4, 0x84 if player 1
				  OR Transmits one of 0x28, 0x38, 0x48, 0x68, 0xf8, 0x88 if player 2

Transmits an unsigned short (2 bytes) indicating the size of the next segment
Then transmits the score of player 1 and the score of player 2 (4 bytes total)
